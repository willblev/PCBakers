  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 ¾ cup all-purpose flour, more for pan
    * Zest of 2 medium organic lemons (you don't want to eat any pesticides which can soak into the peel)
    * 1 cup sugar
    * ½ cup buttermilk
    * juice from 2 medium lemons (~4 tablespoons)
    * 3 large eggs
    * 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
    * ¼ teaspoon baking soda
    * ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
    * ⅔ cup virgin olive oil
    * 1 tablespoon poppy seeds
    * ½ cup confectioners’ sugar (AKA powdered sugar)

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour an 8-inch loaf pan.
    2. In a bowl, combine lemon zest and sugar and rub with your fingers until it looks like wet sand. Whisk in buttermilk, 3 tablespoons lemon juice (saving 1 tablespoon for the glaze), and the eggs. 
    3. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk dry ingredients into the batter, then whisk in oil and poppy seeds.
    4. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center emerges clean, about 1 hour. Let cool in pan until warm to the touch, then turn out onto a baking rack set over a rimmed baking sheet. Turn cake right side up.
    5. Whisk together remaining 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the confectioners’ sugar. Use a pastry brush to spread glaze evenly over top and sides of cake. Cool completely before slicing.

This lemon poppy seed pound cake is light, moist, and has a refreshing citrus kick. It was [based on this recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014800-lemon-poppy-seed-poundcake). I like to sprinkle some extra poppy seeds on the top of the raw batter once the mix has been poured into the baking pan, so the outside of the poundcake will have even more color and texture.

Alternatively, instead of brushing glaze over the cake, you can serve each slice with a portion of [lemon curd]()- which in my opinion is much nicer, but requires more time to prepare.

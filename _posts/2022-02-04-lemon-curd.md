recipe:
  servings: 450g, approximately 3 jars
  prep: 5 minutes
  cook: 30 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 3 large organic lemons (you don't want to eat any pesticides which can soak into the peel)
    * 225 g white sugar
    * 115 g fresh butter (unsalted)
    * 2 large eggs

    0. Prepare a [bain-marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie) AKA double boiler for later. Ideally, the top container will be a >1.5L heat-proof non-metal container (such as a ceramic or Pyrex bowl), as the lemon juice can sometimes acquire a metallic taste from metal pots
    1. Wash and dry the lemons. Zest the lemons taking care to not include any of the white pith, and try to grate the zest very finely. 
    2. After removing all the zest that you can, juice the lemons. You need ~70-75ml of juice, which is approximately 2 lemons' worth of juice.
    3. In a Pyrex or ceramic bowl (which you will later use as the top part of your bain-marie), combine the zest and sugar thoroughly to help grind the zest into even smaller pieces. Add the lemon juice and butter, and place the bowl into your bain-marie over low-medium heat.
    4. Whisk the mixture until the sugar has completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. In a separate container, beat the two eggs. 
    5. While stirring constantly over medium heat, add the eggs to the lemon-butter-sugar mixture little by little, and continue to whisk until it becomes the consistency of a hollandaise sauce, about 10 minutes. It is important to constantly stir, otherwise it will be chunky instead of creamy.
    6. As soon as the mixture reaches the desired consistency, remove the heat source by taking the bowl off of the bain marie and whisk for 30 more seconds. The lemon curd will thicken even more as it cools.

This lemon curd is perfect in every way- sweet but tangy, light but rich, creamy but intense. It can be spread like a jam over bread or scones, added to compliment a dessert, or eaten by the spoonful (it's that good).  

This recipe is taken from the book **Jams, Preserves and Chutneys** by Marguerite Patten, but [similar recipes can be found online](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-make-lemon-curd/). My favorite way to enjoy lemon curd is alongside a slice of [lemon poppy seed poundcake](https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/cakes/2022/02/05/lemon-poppy-seed-cake/). 

[If prepared correctly](https://practicalselfreliance.com/canning-lemon-curd/), the piping-hot lemon curd can be spooned into hot sterile jars and will keep in the fridge for months. Otherwise, lemon curd will last in your fridge for 1-2 weeks.

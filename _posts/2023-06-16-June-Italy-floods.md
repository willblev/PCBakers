# Italy Humanitarian Aid for Flood Relief 

We are organizing an emergency bake sale on June 21st, from 9:00 to 11:00 near the entrance of Cluster II (Av. Doctor Marañon). We will bake to raise money for people affected by the flooding in the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy last month. This emergency Bake Sale aims to contribute to the fundraising efforts organized by the Cesena municipality. The funds raised will cover the costs of evaluating houses and aid in the renovation of homes affected by the flooding.
Hope to see you there!

Please help us spread the word and don’t forget to add the event to your calendars.

 
At the end of the event, as always, PCBakers will transfer 100% of all donations to these groups. If you would like to bring a cake, join the PCBakers club, or propose a charity for a future event, please see the "About" section of our website to find out how to help us bake for change!

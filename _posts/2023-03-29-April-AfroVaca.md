# Proyecto AfroVaca

[Project Afrovaca](https://www.proyectoafrovaca.com/) is a social development aid organization with 20 years of experience that works side-by-side with local coordinators and farmers to improve living conditions and basic production systems in the farming communities of Burkina Faso. It is, therefore, a very local project, which is near and dear to the protagonists- the farmers- and which favors an endogenous and sustainable development.

The Afrovaca Project promotes the financing of bulls and cows for farming families in Burkina Faso. Plowing with oxen allows a better optimization of resources and facilitates food self-sufficiency. The other branch of the project is the creation and regular financing of Solidarity Banks. They are organized in a self-managed way and grant microloans to under-resourced women.

This project has no paid staff either in Burkina Faso nor in Spain, so virtually all of their financial resources are allocated to rural cooperation in this African country where it has a huge impact; a donation of €250 can finance an ox, and €20 is enough for a microloan. The project has financed more than 300 oxen and supports 6 solidarity banks in various communities in Burkina Faso.

Please help us spread the word and don’t forget to add the event to your calendars!

 
At the end of the event, as always, PCBakers will transfer 100% of all donations to the charity of the month. If you would like to bring a cake, join the PCBakers club, or propose a charity for a future event, please see the "About" section of our website to find out how to help us bake for change!

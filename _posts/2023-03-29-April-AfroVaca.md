# Proyecto AfroVaca

The next PCBakers charity bake sale will take place on Tuesday, March 14th. We will be raising money for [@afanoc_org](https://afanoc.org/), an organization which supports families and friends of children with cancer in their emotional, physical, and economic needs.

Everybody will be talking about it, so don’t miss out! Please help us spread the word and don’t forget to add the event to your calendars.

 
At the end of the event, as always, PCBakers will transfer 100% of all donations to these groups. If you would like to bring a cake, join the PCBakers club, or propose a charity for a future event, please see the "About" section of our website to find out how to help us bake for change!

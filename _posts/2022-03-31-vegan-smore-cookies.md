    * 1/2 cup vegan cane sugar

    * 1 tsp sea salt

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Add ground flax and water to a bowl and stir. Set aside. (This makes flax egg)
    2. Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
    3. In a bowl, add softened vegan butter and both sugars. Beat with a mixer (stand or hand) until light and creamy about 2 -3 mins. 
    4. Add in flax egg mixture and vanilla extract. Beat them until combined (about 15 – 20 seconds). 
    5. To the same bowl, add the flour, baking soda and salt and fold with a spatula until combined.
    6. Add 1 cup chips and all crushed graham crackers and use a spatula to fold in. 
    7. Scoop out 3 tablespoons of dough and push in 5-7 marshmallows. Roll into a ball and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough placing 2 inches apart.
    8. Use the other 1/3 cup chips to add to the top of dough balls. 
    9. Bake the cookies for 12 – 14 mins. It’s important to stick to this time frame so you don’t over bake the cookies.  If it seems they need more time, then don’t take them out!
    10. Remove from oven and let cool for at least 5 mins to set. Store any leftovers in an air tight container.

This vegan friendly tried-and-tested recipe is from [here](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-smores-cookies/#recipe). As Paula explained to me, most of the ingredients can be found in your favorite supermarket.

- flax seeds can be found in the "healthy"/"food allergy friendly" section of many supermarkets, as well as "a granel" stores
- vegan butter can be found in most supermarkets; a very good brand is Violife, which is sold at Carrefour and BonPreu, but you can find alternatives in Mercadona
- vegan chocolate chips are sold in many places; I get mine from Mercadona
- vegan marshmallows are a bit harder to find; you probably have to get them in vegan stores like [somvegans](https://somvegans.com/).
- vegan sugar: most sugars are vegan like la Azucarera and so on; however, there are some baking-grade sugars that have egg products included in them, so please be sure to read the labels on all of your ingredients before labeling your food as vegan

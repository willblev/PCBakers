# Cure Alzheimer's Fund
[Cure Alzheimer's Fund](http://curealz.org/)

This month we will be raising money for the Cure Alzheimer's Fund, a highly rated charity organization which directly finances primary research of Alzheimer's disease with the aim of developing effective treatments and preventative strategies. 

We will have dozens of homemade pastries for you to try (with a suggested donation of 3€ per portion), as well as artisanal V60 coffee and percolator coffee (with an additional donation). 

At the end of the event, as always, PCBakers will transfer 100% of all donations to the charity. If you would like to bring a cake, join the PCBakers club, or propose a charity for a future event, please see the "About" section of our website to find out how to help us bake for change!

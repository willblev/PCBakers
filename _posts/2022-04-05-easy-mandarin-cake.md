  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * approx. 375 grams mandarin oranges (about 5); use the 'Clementine' variety if possible as they are sweeter
    * 6 large eggs
    * 225 grams white sugar
    * 250 grams ground almonds
    * 1 teaspoon baking powder (baking powder sometimes contains gluten, so beware if you want to make a gluten-free cake)
    * Optional: you may add the zest of 1/2 orange to the cake mix to amp up the citrus flavors and aromas

    1. Put the unpeeled mandarins in a large pot, add enough cold water to cover them, and bring the water to a boil on high heat. 
    2. Turn down the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid until you have a gentle simmer. Simmer for 2 hours, then discard the cooking water, and let the mandarins cool off until they are cold enough to handle.
    3. Cut the mandarins in half and remove any seeds or stems. Put the mandarins (skins, pith, fruit and all) in a food processor or blender and purée them. Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/190ºC/170°C Fan/375ºF. Lightly grease a pan ( eg. a 20cm / 8 inch round Springform tin) with neutral flavored oil.
    2. You can then add the other ingredients directly to the food processor and mix. Alternatively, you can beat the eggs by hand, then add the sugar, almonds and baking powder, mixing well, and finally adding the fruit purée.
    3. Pour the cake mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 1 hour; you can poke the middle with a wooden skewer or toothpick every 5' starting at 40', and if it comes out clean, it is done. You'll probably have to cover the cake with foil after about 40 minutes to prevent the the top from burning. Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack, but still inside the tin. After >4 hours when it reaches room temperature, you can take it out of the tin.

This mandarin orange cake recipe is a new spin on an old traditional Sephardic orange cake recipe. It's fairly simple, as it only has 5 ingredients, and is gluten & dairy free. It can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week; some people say that this cake tastes better a day or two after it is baked, but its flavor is sure to delight at any time.

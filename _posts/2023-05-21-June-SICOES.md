# Asociación SICOES (Síndrome de Cohen España)

This month, the PCBakers will raise money for the SICOES (Síndrome de Cohen España) association.

SICOES is an association founded in 2019 by families of children with Cohen syndrome. Cohen syndrome is an ultra-rare disease that affects less than 1000 people worldwide. It causes multiple alterations, being microcephaly, intellectual disability and retinal degeneration the most common ones. So far, it is an incurable disease that cannot be reversed or slowed down. Due to this low prevalence, research on this syndrome is practically nonexistent. For this reason, 17 families of Spanish Cohen syndrome patients have created this association whose main objective is to directly promote research on the disease.

Everybody will be talking about it, so don’t miss out! Please help us spread the word and don’t forget to add the event to your calendars.

 
At the end of the event, as always, PCBakers will transfer 100% of all donations to these groups. If you would like to bring a cake, join the PCBakers club, or propose a charity for a future event, please see the "About" section of our website to find out how to help us bake for change!

# Fundació Noelia

Tuesday, February 28th is Rare Disease day- the PCBakers will be organizing a bake sale to raise funds for the Fundació Noelia charity from 9:00-11:00 near the entrance of Cluster II near Av. Doctor Marañon.

100% of all donations will go directly to the [Fundació Noelia](https://fundacionnoelia.org/en/) which represents and helps people who have been affected by a rare type of congenital muscular distrophy (CMD) which is caused by a deficit in collagen VI, and affects fewer than 1 in 30,000 children. 
The foundation works to raise awareness, promote research projects which seek to understand and cure this rare disease, and support the individuals and the families who are impacted by CMD collagen VI deficiency. 

At the end of the event, as always, PCBakers will transfer 100% of all donations to these groups. If you would like to bring a cake, join the PCBakers club, or propose a charity for a future event, please see the "About" section of our website to find out how to help us bake for change!

	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the PCBakers website!</p>

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/PCB_bake_sale_map.png" width="300" alt="PCB_bake_sale_map">

	<p>Each month we organize a bake sale for a different charity here at the <a href="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/" target="_blank">Parc Cient√≠fic de Barcelona</a>. Charity bake sales are a tried-and-tested method to raise money for good causes while simultaneously enjoying delicious food and new meeting people who you otherwise might not see on your daily routine.</p>
		
	<p>Upcoming bake sales will be announced via the PCB internal newsletter <i>T'Interessa</i>, as well as on the digital screens and on analog billboards throughout the PCB.</p>
	
	<p>The PCBakers is an offshoot of the <a href="https://ellipse.prbb.org/keep-baking-for-a-better-world-5-years-of-incubakers-at-the-prbb/" target="_blank">Incubakers</a>, an organization which began in 2013 at the PRBB.</p>
			
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>Any individual or group from the PCB can propose a cause by <a href="https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/contact/">contacting the PCBakers Organizers</a>. After the PCBakers Organizers coordinate with you to confirm a date for your proposed charity bake sale, then you are responsible for organizing and running the bake sale on that date. At the end of each bake sale, we announce how much money was raised, and send 100% of all donations to the charity!</p>
	
	<p>Does that sound complicated? Don't worry! There is an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9xcoaaUlmzsTDwRcUWl9NTssWzNH8cr5wyLd2cCqiM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">easy-to-follow guide</a> to make sure each bake sale is a success, and of course the PCBakers Organizers are always available to <a href="https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/contact/">answer any last-minute questions</a>.</p>

	<p>Welcome to the PCBakers website! Here you can find recipes, information about upcoming bake sales, and how to support our initiative.</p>
	
	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<p>PCBakers was created in April 2022 at the <a href="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/" target="_blank">Parc Científic de Barcelona</a> (PCB). This idea was inspired by the <a href="https://ellipse.prbb.org/keep-baking-for-a-better-world-5-years-of-incubakers-at-the-prbb/" target="_blank">Incubakers</a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/theincubakers/" target=" blank">Incubakers Instagram</a>), another group at the PRBB which has been going since 2013.</p>

	<p>We are an informal group of over one hundred members who work all around the PCB, representing dozens of different companies and institutes. Some of us like to bake, some like to help run the bake sales, but <i>all of us</i> enjoy sampling all of the delicious homemade cakes and cookies!</p>
	<p>Part of our initiative is to engage with the PCB community, encouringing charitable donations and raising awareness about important causes, all while fostering inclusion and equality. We welcome all feedback on how we could improve the organization and our events!</p>

	<h2>What is a PCBakers bake sale?</h2>

	<p>Once a month, we organize a charity bake sale breakfast at the PCB. 100% of donations go directly to the charity, and each month we raise funds for a different charity; anyone at the PCB is welcome to join the PCBakers group and propose a charity for a future event! </p>
		
	<p>On the morning of a bake sale, the event organizers set up a few tables, and volunteers bring in their delicious homemade pastries. </p>

	<p>The organizers then label all of the donated pastries, separating the allergen-free options as much as possible and dividing them into generous portions. Finally, we start serving food to anyone who decides to stop by and help support the cause (€3 donation per portion is suggested). We also serve coffee and juice! </p>

<h2>Why organize a bake sale instead of something else?</h2>

	<p>Charity bake sales are an excellent way to raise money for charity; participants get a tasty breakfast, they learn about a new cause, and meet new people from the PCB community. For our very first bake sale in <a href="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/en/more-than-e1000-raised-at-pcbakers-first-bake-sale/" target="blank">May 2022</a>, we raised over €1000 in one morning!</p>
		
	<p>All of our upcoming events will be announced via the PCB internal newsletter <i>T'Interessa</i>, as well as on the home page of this website and our social media accounts. If you want to make sure that you'll never miss out, sign up to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/PCBakers" target="_blank">Google Group</a>!</p>
			
	<h2>How do the logistics work?</h2>
	<p>Anyone from the PCB can join the PCBakers group, and if they want to, suggest their favorite charity for future bake sale by <a href="https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/contact/">contacting the PCBakers Coordinators</a>. If you would like to volunteer to bring food, drinks, or help out during an event, that is always welcome! PCBaker members have no obligation to bake or participate <i>every month</i>- we have over a hundred members, so if only one of every five PCBakers bakes a cake, we still would have plenty of food!</p>
		
		
	<p>The PCBakers Coordinators will coordinate with the PCB to confirm a date. Once the event date is set, the person or group who initially proposed the charity is responsible for organizing the event itself, but they can count on the rest of the PCBakers crew for help! </p>

	<p>At the end of each bake sale, the organizers count up how much money was collected, and donate 100% to the charity that they picked!</p>

	<p>If you'd like to propose a cause for a future bake sale, we have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9xcoaaUlmzsTDwRcUWl9NTssWzNH8cr5wyLd2cCqiM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">step-by-step checklist</a> which explains the whole process. This "PCBakers protocol" checklist guarantees that each bake sale will be a success. And remember, the PCBakers Coordinators and PCBakers crew will always be available to <a href="https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/contact/">help with any questions</a>.</p>
			
	<h2>How can I help?</h2>
	<p>You can help our initiative in many ways such as baking something, donating drinks like milk or juice, helping to advertise future events, volunteering to help run a bake sale, or proposing a charity for a future bake sale. The PCBaker crew is always growing and improving, and we would love to have you with us! If you do decide to become a PCBakers member, keep in mind that <i>you are not obliged to help every month</i>; you can decide if/how you would like to participate each month, so there is no risk that anyone will burnout from too much baking!</p>
	
	<p>Are you convinced yet? If so (<i>Yay!</i>) the first step is to join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/PCBakers" target="_blank">PCBakers Google Group here</a>; once we've approved your request, you'll be able to access our group conversations and shared documents.</p>

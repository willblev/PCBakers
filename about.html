	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the PCBakers website! Each month we organize a bake sale for a different charity here at the <a href="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/" target="_blank">Parc Cient√≠fic de Barcelona</a>.</p>

	<p>The PCBakers is an offshoot of the <a href="https://ellipse.prbb.org/keep-baking-for-a-better-world-5-years-of-incubakers-at-the-prbb/" target="_blank">Incubakers, an organization which began in 2013 at the PRBB</a>.</p>

	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>Any individual or group from the PCB can propose a cause by contacting the PCBakers Organizers. Once the PCBakers Organizers confirm a date for each proposed charity bake sale, then the individual/group which proposed the charity will be responsible for organizing the bake sale on that date. At the end of each bake sale, we announce how much money was raised and send 100% of the donations to the charity. Sound complicated? Don't worry! There is an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9xcoaaUlmzsTDwRcUWl9NTssWzNH8cr5wyLd2cCqiM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">easy-to-follow guide called the "PCBakers protocol"</a> to ensure that each event runs smoothly, and the PCBakers Organizers are always available to answer your questions.</p>

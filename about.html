	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the PCBakers website! Here you can find recipes, information about upcoming bake sales, and learn how to join our little initiative. 
	
	<h2>Who are the PCBakers?</h2>
	<p>We are an informal association of researchers, technicians, and employees who work in the <a href="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/" target="_blank">Parc Científic de Barcelona</a> (PCB). Some of us like to bake more than others, but all of the the PCBakers crew enjoy eating cakes and cookies for a good cause!</p>
	
	<p>The PCBakers group is an offshoot of the <a href="https://ellipse.prbb.org/keep-baking-for-a-better-world-5-years-of-incubakers-at-the-prbb/" target="_blank">Incubakers</a>, an organization which began in 2013 at the PRBB, and has <b><a href="https://ellipse.prbb.org/call-for-action-the-incubakers-are-back-and-looking-for-reinforcements/" target="_blank">raised over €30,000</a></b> for dozens of different charities!</p>

	<h2>What is a PCBakers bake sale?</h2>

	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/PCB_bake_sale_map.png" width="300" alt="PCB_bake_sale_map">

	<p>Once a month, the PCBakers help to organize a charity bake sale breakfast (desayuno solidario) where volunteer bakers bring in their homemade pastries to the PCB. Anyone can come to enjoy a piece of these delicious baked goods, and in exchange, we request that they donate some money (€3 is suggested) towards the charity of the month. Each month the PCBakers will raise money for a different cause. Charity bake sales are a tried-and-tested method to raise money for good causes while simultaneously enjoying good food and meeting new faces at the PCB who you otherwise might never see in your daily routine.</p>
		
	<p>Upcoming events will be announced via the PCB internal newsletter <i>T'Interessa</i>, on the home page of this website, and through some organizations' internal mailing lists. To make sure that you never miss a bake sale, you can sign up to our Google Group (see below)!</p>
			
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>Any individual or group from the PCB can propose a cause by <a href="https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/contact/">contacting the PCBakers Organizers</a>. After the PCBakers Organizers coordinate with you to confirm a date for your bake sale, then you and your group will be responsible for organizing and running the bake sale on that date. At the end of each bake sale, we announce how much money was raised, and send 100% of all donations to the charity!</p>
	
	<p>Does that sound complicated? Don't worry! There is an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9xcoaaUlmzsTDwRcUWl9NTssWzNH8cr5wyLd2cCqiM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">easy-to-follow guide</a> to make sure that each bake sale is a success. And as always, the PCBakers Organizers are available to <a href="https://willblev.github.io/PCBakers/contact/">answer any last-minute questions</a>.</p>
						
			
	<h2>How can I participate?</h2>
	<p>The PCBaker crew is over 40 members, and we are still growing! If you decide to sign up, this doesn't mean you are <i>forever obliged to participate in all upcoming bake sales</i>! You can choose if/how you wish to participate in each event however you please :-)</p>
